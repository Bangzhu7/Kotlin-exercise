# Android Country Flags App

This is a simple Android application built with Jetpack Compose that displays a list of countries with their flags in styled cards. The project demonstrates UI customization, custom fonts, theme switching (light/dark mode), and Material You dynamic color.

## Features

- **Custom UI Components:** Displays country information in `Card` composables.
- **Custom Font:** Uses the "Geo" font from Google Fonts for a unique look.
- **Layouts:** A `Column` is used to stack the cards vertically, and a `Row` within each card arranges the flag and text horizontally.
- **Styling:** Cards have custom shapes and colors. Flag images are clipped into circles.
- **Adaptive Theming:** The app supports both light and dark modes based on the system setting.
- **Dynamic Color:** Implements Material You dynamic coloring, which adapts the app's color scheme to the user's wallpaper on Android 12+.
- **Custom App Icon:** The default launcher icon is replaced with a custom globe icon.
