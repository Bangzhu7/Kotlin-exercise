# Employee Salary Calculation (Kotlin Inheritance Example)

## Description

This Kotlin program demonstrates **inheritance and polymorphism** by creating a base class `Employee` and two subclasses:

- `FullTimeEmployee`: Adds a fixed bonus to the base salary.
- `PartTimeEmployee`: Calculates salary based on hourly rate and hours worked.

A `mapOf` is used to store multiple employees, and a loop displays each employee’s calculated salary.

## Files

- `Main.kt` — Kotlin source code.
- `output.txt` — Program output or screenshot.

## Features

- Demonstrates inheritance (`open` and `override`)
- Uses `mapOf` to store and iterate over employee data
- Shows polymorphic behavior via `calculateSalary()`

## How to Run

1. Open Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Create a new **Kotlin Console Application**.
3. Replace the content of `Main.kt` with the provided code.
4. Run the program.
